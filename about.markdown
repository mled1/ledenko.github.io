I am a graduate of Capital University Law School with a __Juris Doctor__. I have
a Bachelors of Science from Ohio State in Security and Intelligence and a Minor
in Environmental Sciences. I'm a technology enthusiast, particualry data
privacy and consumer technologies&mdash;especially where these intersect with
the Fourth Amendment. My other hobbies include gaming of both the video and
tabletop varieties, cycling, beer-making, and reading. I'm always looking for a
new hobby, suggestions welcome. I have strong opinions on privacy, typography,
punctuation generally, and the Oxford comma specifically.
