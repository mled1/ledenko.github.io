Thanks for visiting my new website. I'm a recent law grad from Capital
University Law School. I have worked for state agencies, the federal judiciary,
and a public defender's office. You can find more details in my
[Resume](mledenko.github.io/resume). If you want to get in
touch, please use this [form](mledenko.github.io/contact). I will make every
effor to respond quickly, but be advised I'm currently studying for a bar exam
that's not likely to take place because of the corona virus pandemic. So it
goes. Wash your hands, wear a mask, and practice good social distancing habits.
